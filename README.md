# RolyVis
Simple visualization of 2D structures as generated by [Roly.jl](https://github.com/mxhbl/Roly.jl). The visualization here tools are outsourced into a separate repository to avoid dependency issues. This repo may be merged back into Roly.jl at some point.

## Usage
Generate structures with Roly.jl and then use `draw_polyforms(strs, assembly_system, "filename.png//pdf")` to create a `png` or `pdf` drawing of the ensemble.
